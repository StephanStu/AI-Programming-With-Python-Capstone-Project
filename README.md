# Udacity's Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program: The Capstone Project
This repository is part of my journey through Udacity's Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Program. The project was rated as passed in August 2019. See here for details of the program see [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089). The repository with the virgin files can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/aipnd-project).


## Project Overview: The _Tech Case_
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, an image classifier will be trained to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

In this repository you have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Here the network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with these tools depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. They can be applied for example to train the same network to classify traffic lights or traffic signs in autonomous vehicles.
